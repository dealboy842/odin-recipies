    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine in a bowl and toss to coat. Let
                marinate for at least 20 minutes at room temperature and up to 3 hours.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining soy sauce with corn starch and stir with a fork to form a slurry. Add

                onions in a bowl and set aside. Combine garlic, ginger, and scallions in a bowl and set aside.</li><br>
            <li><b>To Cook On A Burner: </b><br>When ready to cook, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat until
                smoking. <br>
                Add half of beef and cook without moving until well seared, about 1 minute. <br>
                Continue cooking while stirring and tossing until lightly cooked but still pink in spots, about 1 minute. <br> 
                Transfer to a large bowl. <br> 
                Repeat with 1 more tablespoon of oil and remaining beef, adding beef to same bowl. <br> 
                Wipe out wok. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon oil and half of peppers and onions. <br> 
                Transfer to bowl with beef. Repeat with remaining oil and remaining peppers/onions. <br> 
                Return wok to high heat until smoking. Return peppers/onions/beef to wok and add garlic/ginger/scallion mixture. <br> 
                Cook, tossing and stirring until
                fragrant, about 30 seconds. <br> 
                Add sauce and cook, tossing and stirring constantly until lightly thickened, about 45 seconds longer. <br> 
                Carefully transfer to a serving platter and serve.. <br></li>
